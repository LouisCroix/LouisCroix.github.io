## About Me

Chaohao Yang will graduate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen this summer and has been accepted by the M.S.E. program in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, he is very interested in the low-precision (quantization/FP4) training and deployment of large language models and other foundation models. In addition, he also has some insights into the design of the position embedding of foundation models. He hopes to become a research assistant for professors in related fields to pave the way for applying for a Ph.D. degree in the future.
